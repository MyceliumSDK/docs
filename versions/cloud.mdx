Cloud version is no-pain version of the SDK, when everything is handled under the hood for an integrator. The only thing that an integrator need to pass to the SDK during the initialization is an API key and few settings. All further 3d party platforms integrations will be handled under the hood by Mycelium. To start working with a self hosted SDK version, please refer to the [Self-hosted version](/versions/self-hosted/overview)
