````markdown
To test the SDK you can use the build in CLI from the same repository:

1. Go to `packages/cli` and install dependencies

```bash
cd packages/cli && pnpm install
```

2. Setup the CLI settings based on the README.md file

3. Start the CLI

```bash
pnpm run start
```

> In case if you want to test the SDK with a fork, you need to use `anvil` and `packages/blockchain` service. Please refer to `packages/blockchain/README.md` for more details
