To get started with the Self-hosted version you need to fork/clone the Mycelium SDK repo and build the project. Here are quick steps how to make this

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repo">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MyceliumSDK/mycelium-sdk.git
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build the SDK">
    ```bash
    cd package/sdk && pnpm install
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The built SDK can then be used in your application or imported as a local library to any of your local project
</Tip>

## Varialbes

To use the SDK in the self-hosted mode, you need to provide several necessary environment variables during the SDK initialization, similar how it was with the [Cloud version](/versions/cloud)

<Tip>
  You don't need to provide any variables for the SDK before the building process. Environment variables are necessary only for using the SDK after
</Tip>

You can check the [Varialbes](/versions/self-hosted/variables) section to get the list of all necessary varialbes

## Testing

There is an infrastructure in Mycelium SDK monorepo to test the self-hosted version and start contributoin to the project

You can use local SDK with a chain fork along with pre-build faucet. To quickly interact with a build SDK you can also use a ready-to-use CLI

You can use CLI with SDK to qucikly test its functionality
