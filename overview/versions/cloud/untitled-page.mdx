  Get a key to start using Mycelium Cloud
</Card>

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a simple project">
    Create a simple project to test the SDK

    ```bash
    pnpm init -y
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Mycelium SDK">
    ```bash
    pnpm install @mycelium-sdk/core
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Init SDK">
    Initiate an SDK with basic settings and API key

    <Tip>
      \*\*Don't know what is risk level? \*\*[**Read about it!**](/protocols)
    </Tip>
    ```typescript
    import { MyceliumSDK } from "@mycelium-sdk/core";
    
    const sdk = await MyceliumSDK.init({
      apiKey: "sk_...",
      chainId: 8453,
      protocolsSecurityConfig: {
        riskLevel: "low",
      },
    });
    ```

    This will initiate an SDK object that you can use further to manage web3 account and getting DeFi opportunities
  </Step>
  <Step title="That's it!">
    You're done! Right now you can check which DeFi opportunities are available so far

    ```typescript
    await sdk.protocols.getBestVaults()
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
