---

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:

  - Node.js version 22.11.00 or higher
  - pnpm 10.9.0 or higher
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Mycelium SDK for your product

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a simple project">
    Create a simple project to test the SDK

    ```bash
    pnpm init -y
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Mycelium SDK">
    ```bash
    pnpm install @mycelium-sdk/core
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Init SDK">
    Initiate an SDK with basic settings and API key (how to get an API key?)

    ```typescript
    import { MyceliumSDK } from "@mycelium-sdk/core";
    
    const sdk = await MyceliumSDK.init({
      apiKey: "sk_...",
      chainId: 8453,
      protocolsSecurityConfig: {
        riskLevel: "low",
      },
    });
    ```

    This will initiate an SDK object that you can use further to manage web3 account and getting DeFi opportunities
  </Step>
  <Step title="That's it!">
    You're done! Right now you can check which DeFi opportunities are available so far

    ```typescript
    await sdk.protocols.getBestVaults()
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SDK limitations

The SDK is the server only and can't be used directly on frontend. To use Mycelium for frontend projects you need to create a basic API to access SDK abilities

<Note>
  The React library is currently under development and will be available soon. Stay tuned on our [GitHub](https://github.com/MyceliumSDK/mycelium-sdk/tree/main)
</Note>

## SDK settings

There are several parameters that you need to define on the initialization step before using the SDK except of API key. To get more information about which settings can be provided and for what they are responsible to, you can check the [SDK settings](/sdk-settings)

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How to get an API key?">
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The SDK is failing on the init step">
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Then run `mint dev` again.
