To start work with Mycelium Cloud and forget about handling any 3d party services, you need to have an API key for the SDK

To get the API key you simply need to fill the form and our team wil review you request and send the API key with detailed information (limits and expiration period) back

<Tip>
  Currently the Mycelium Cloud is in beta version and access is limited to all people. Because of this, we're reviewing each request, but not everyon could get a key
